# Calculator

A simple calculator app made with HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript.

## Skills Strengthened

1. DOM Manipulation using JavaScript
2. Usage of CSS Grid
3. UI/UX Design including use of color and effects to draw the eye to certain places on the page and display interaction

## Issues I overcame

1. Blocking the user from entering multiple operators or decimals in a single operand to prevent invalid input

## What I would do differently

- I would use an array to store the input to make it easier to get previous operators or operands. With the current implementation, I needed to index through a string that included white space around the operators. This made manipulation when preventing invalid input or deleting slightly more error prone.
